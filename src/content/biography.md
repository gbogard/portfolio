Hi there! Thanks for stopping by on my portfolio. 
My name is Guillaume Bogard, I am  a full-stack developer with a focus
on functional programming, living in Lille, nothern France.

Javascript, Scala and Clojure are my main programming languages. I enjoy playing around with
various technologies, especially functional languages. I've learned a bit of Rust and Haskell
for fun on my spare time, and I spend hours configuring my editor in Emacs Lisp.

I have a passion for scalability, concurent programming, and building abstractions.
My other activities include writing, mostly about software on my [blog](/blog), and
speaking in meetups and conferences, mostly to exchange on functional programming.
I've had the opportunity to host a talk at the Scala.io conference in 2018.

My hobbies include going to the movies, riding rollercoasters and learning foreign languages.
My native language is French,  I am fluent in English, and I am currently learning Swedish.

Tack för att du läser :)

## The tech tools I use

Those are the tools I use as part of my daily workflow.

### Software

#### Text editor : emacs

I've switched to [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) in late 2018 after several years of using
Intellij IDEA along with Visual Studio Code. I'm a polyglot developer, swithing betzeen Javascript, Typescript,
Scala and Clojure sometimes several times a day. Having great support for all the languages I use in a single editor
was my main motivation for switching to emacs in the first place. Besides, Intellij is a rather beefy piece of software
(a rather expensive one too), and having my editor taking so much of my system resources was starting to annoy me.

With emacs, I also discovered a very rich ecosystem of packages, and the joy of being able to configure and program
absolutely anything. I came for the language support, I stayed for the added productivity.

I've actually put my personal emacs config on Github, including all the packages I use for day-to-day Scala, Clojure
and Javascript development. Check it out [here](https://github.com/gbogard/emacs.d) :)

#### Terminal + Shell

On MacOs, I use iTerm 2. On Linux, I typically use Terminator. On my new machines, installing
[Oh my ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) is one of the first things I do.

#### Desktop apps 

* For music, I use Spotify and it's open on my desktop pretty much all-day long.
* For testing APIs, I use [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)

#### Operating system

My business laptop being a Macbook Pro, I spend ;ost of my day in MacOs Mojave. However, I also have Archlinux
on my desktop at home.  

### Keyboard

I'm a bit of a keyboard nerd. I always carry a [Vortex Race 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_kVAxA7-SU&t=82s)
TKL mechanical keyboard with Cherry Red switches in my bag. Especially given how poor the latest Macbook pro
keyboards are.

Today, I would like to introduce you to a JavaScript library I canot live without anymore. Ramda is
a utility library, similar in purpose to Lodash or Underscore, built with functional programming
in mind. Compared to the aforementioned libraries, Ramda enables a radically different style of
programming, based on function composition.

In this post, I'd like to cover concrete examples of everyday Ramda usage. I hope that reading this
introduction will give you a convincing glimpse at the library's potential, and inspire you to use
it in your projects.

Let's get started!

## The need for utility libraries

As mentioned before, Ramda is not the first utility library for JavaScript. You have probably
aready heard of libraries like Lodash before. But just in case you haven't, here are some example
of what Lodash can provide.

## Ramda is different

## Concision for the win

## Let the data flow

## It's just the beginning
